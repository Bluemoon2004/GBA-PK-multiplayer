# GBA-PK-multiplayer

This is a free mod that will in the future support 4 players and allow interactions between all of the 3rd generation pokemon games. Alpha 1 currently allows 2 players to see each other in the game of Firered or Leafgreen, however they must both be using the same rom and game version. Updates and more information can be found on youtube, patreon or pokecommunity.
